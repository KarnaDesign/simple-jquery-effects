# Simple jQuery Effects

I decided to create a small project to practice some of my jQuery skills that I haven't had the opportunity to use 
in other projects yet. 

For now, the features used are as follows:

 * Changing colour
 * fadeOut/fadeIn
 * slideUp/slideDown
 * animate
 
 
## Upcoming features

I'm planning to add the following features (and more, probably):

 * Fix the animate-thingy (so that you don't need to refresh the page to run it again).
